Available targets:

clean       - Cleans all object files.  Useful when rebuilding a submodule.
              This will also work at the top level, but it may be more
              efficient to remove the ‘build’ directory.

clobber     - Cleans all object files.  Additionally removes targets
              (executable, library, plug-in)
cleandeps   - Cleans all dependency files.  Useful if a header file has been
              removed or added.

cleantarget - Removes only the target, but not the objects.  Useful for
              re-linking a target.

cleant      - alias for 'cleantarget'

cleanstaging- Removes staging directory for current platform.  Useful when
              version number has increased.

quick       - Parallel build.  Performs a depth-first build, and builds with the
              number of threads specified in the J parameter.  Current
              configuration is set to $(J)

help        - Prints this help message to the screen

release     - Specifically builds for release.  This overrides the BUILD_FLAVOR
              parameter from make.conf (currently set to $(BUILD_FLAVOR)

debug       - Specifically builds for debug.  This overrides the BUILD_FLAVOR
              parameter from make.conf (currently set to $(BUILD_FLAVOR)

version     - Prints the product version number.  This is useful for automated
              build scripts.

all         - Builds both release and debug.

all-flavors - Builds both release and debug.

all-flavors-quick - Builds both release and debug with ‘quick’ for parallel builds
